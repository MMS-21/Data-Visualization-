# **Hospital Operational Efficiency**

## **Objective**

Analyze hospital operations focusing on:

* Patient wait times
* Surgery durations
* Department performance

## **Key Metrics**

* Average Wait Time to Surgery Ratio
* Patients Meeting Wait Time Target
* Average Surgery Duration
* Average Wait Time

## **Key Insights**

* **Orthopedics** accounts for 4.25K hours of surgery duration, indicating a resource bottleneck.
* Patients exceeding target wait times are higher in specific departments like **General Practice**.
* **Renal** and **Gastroenterology** have slightly better efficiency.

## **Recommendations**

* **Optimize Surgery Scheduling:** Streamline preoperative procedures in Orthopedics.
* **Resource Allocation:** Reallocate staff/resources to high-demand departments.
* **Patient Flow Improvement:** Introduce predictive analytics for better scheduling.
