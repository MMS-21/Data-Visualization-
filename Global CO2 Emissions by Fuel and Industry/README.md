# Global CO2 Emissions by Fuel and Industry

The burning of fossil fuels for energy and industrial processes is the main source of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2). 
![Emissions Per Industry](https://github.com/MMS-21/Data-Visualization-/blob/8fa2fa0335fbb717a02530e82b8d0a165bd5b59f/Global%20CO2%20Emissions%20by%20Fuel%20and%20Industry/CO2%20FUEL%2C%20INDUSTRY.png)
> Here's a breakdown of global CO2 emissions by fuel and industry:

### Coal: 
- Coal combustion is the single largest source of CO2 emissions globally, although its use has been declining in recent years due to concerns about air pollution and climate change.
### Oil: 
- Oil is another major source of CO2 emissions, used for transportation, heating, and industrial processes.
### Natural Gas: 
- Natural gas burns cleaner than coal but still emits CO2. Its use is increasing as a transition fuel away from coal.
### Cement: 
- The cement industry is a significant contributor to CO2 emissions due to the chemical process involved in clinker production, a key ingredient in cement.
> The data shows that coal, oil, and gas are the major contributors to CO2 emissions, while cement production also plays a role. The exact percentage contribution varies depending on the source, but coal combustion is generally considered the largest single source.
### Here are some additional points to consider:

#### Electricity Generation: 
- A significant portion of CO2 emissions from fossil fuels comes from electricity generation.

#### Transportation: 
- Transportation is another major source of CO2 emissions, primarily from gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles.

#### Industrial Processes: 
- Various industrial processes, beyond cement production, also emit CO2. These include steel production, chemical manufacturing, and food processing.

#### Global Efforts: 
- There is a growing international focus on reducing CO2 emissions to mitigate climate change. This includes transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and developing carbon capture and storage technologies.

> By understanding the sources of CO2 emissions, we can work towards solutions to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and transition to a cleaner energy future.
