### [**Project 1: CO2 Emissions per capita For 2020**]([project1/][([https://github.com/MMS-21/SQL/tree/9cc51c6e8ae0d2b4d2a2305075617b15a85a9ea4/Analysis%20of%20Chinook%20Database%20Of%20a%20digital%20media%20store)](https://github.com/MMS-21/SQL/tree/f3922eb8e3afdf9f732e49c62f5ba4bfc71fa665/Analysis%20of%20Chinook%20Database%20Of%20a%20digital%20media%20store](https://github.com/MMS-21/Data-Visualization-/tree/65f3deb8e502f5bd6a409b349dde492b2d2cd4a0/CO2%20Emissions%20per%20capita%20For%202020)))

#### Description: 
This visualization presents CO2 emissions data for the 20 countries with the highest CO2 emissions per capita in 2020, all with populations exceeding 5 million.
-	X-axis (Horizontal): The Countries Population, Thousands(2020, World Bank)
-	Y-axis (Vertical): GDP (US $ Millions, 2020, World Bank)
#### Data for Each Country:
-	CO2 Emissions per Capita Trend: Line graph showing emissions per person from 2000 to 2020 (tonnes).
-	Total CO2 Emissions (2020): The circle symbol represents the total amount of CO2 emitted by the country in 2020.
#### Key Insights:
- Provides a clear picture of which countries with large populations are also the biggest per capita emitters of CO2.
-	Allows for comparison of emission trends across these countries over two decades.
