## Description: 
This visualization presents CO2 emissions data for the 20 countries with the highest CO2 emissions per capita in 2020, all with populations exceeding 5 million.
-	X-axis (Horizontal): The Countries Population, Thousands(2020, World Bank)
-	Y-axis (Vertical): GDP (US $ Millions, 2020, World Bank)

## INFO:
-	CO2 Emissions per Capita Trend: Line graph showing emissions per person from 2000 to 2020 (tonnes).
-	Total CO2 Emissions (2020): The circle symbol represents the total amount of CO2 emitted by the country in 2020.
-	Total Population. (Thousands,2020)
-	GDP (US $ Millions, 2020)
## Insights:
- Provides a clear picture of which countries with large populations are also the biggest per capita emitters of CO2.
- This visualization allows us to compare CO2 emissions per capita across these highly populated countries.
-	Allows for comparison of emission trends across these countries over two decades.
## Findings:
- The United States is the country with the highest total CO2 emissions in 2020, followed by China, India, Russia, and Japan.
- The United States also has the highest CO2 emissions per capita in 2020, followed by Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Canada.
- China's CO2 emissions per capita have increased more than any other country since 2000.
- The CO2 emissions of most European countries have decreased since 2000.
- The CO2 emissions of most developing countries have increased since 2000.
- Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are significant contributors to global CO2 emissions due to their large oil industries. Here's a breakdown of the situation:
   - Oil Production and Emissions:
       - These countries hold vast oil reserves and are major oil producers.
       - Extracting, refining, and burning oil releases CO2, a major greenhouse gas contributing to climate change.

**NOTE: There is a Key part that must be considered reviewing before trying to interpret the Visualization**
- The Legend: it explains the symbols, lines, and colours used to represent different data points or variables.
  - It is Divided into three parts.
